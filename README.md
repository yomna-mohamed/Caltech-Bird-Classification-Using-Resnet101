# Caltech-Bird-Classification-Using-Resnet101
Using Caltech Bird dataset on fully connected neural network and pretrained Resnet101 from keras (after applying fine-tuning)
The purpose of this assignment is to gain experience building and training neural networks. You will learn:

Design and train a fully-connected neural network
Train an existing CNN architecture using fine-tuning
Visualize the trained model
